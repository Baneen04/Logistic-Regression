# Logistic-Regression
Logistic Regression Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, where the goal is to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous outcome, logistic regression predicts categorical outcomes, typically encoded as 0 or 1.
